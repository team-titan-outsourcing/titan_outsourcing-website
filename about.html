                        Born and raised in Bago City, Negros Occidental, Philippines, Bethany experienced and saw first hand how easily her country men and women were undervalued, and under paid.
                        Her vision to truly care about both her VA's and client's is second to none. She has gone above and beyond to help those around her and will go above and beyond to help you too.</p>

It was at that moment he fell in love with the Philippines and its people. After the military Corey began his entrepreneur journey in 2013 and has grown several businesses and been apart of multiple ventures. One of his beliefs is, the fact he will never place Virtual Assistant with a client he himself would not employ within his own company. His dedication to taking care of his clients is his mission for Titan Outsourcing.</p>
